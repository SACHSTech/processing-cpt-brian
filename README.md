# Brian the Game 

## Overview

This is game where a car must go against a tank.
If the car collects 3 coins, it wins.
If the tank can eliminate the car's 3 lives by shooting it with bullets before it can collect 3 coins, the tank wins. 

## Controls

The car is moved left and right with the A and D keys. The powerups are activated using q and e (more on this later)

## Powerups

Two powerups are availble to the car.

 A bullet bill, when collected, will be displayed with an indicator at the bottom right. Pressing q with this powerup available will remove all active bullets from the screen.

A lightning bolt, when collected, will permenantly increase the speed the car can move left and right. The amount of bolts collected is displayed at the bottom left. This effect can permenantly stack. 

## User Interface

The amount of bullets the tank has is displayed at the top right. The tank carries a maxiumum of 4 bullets.

The lives (shields) and coins of the car are also displayed at the top right.
